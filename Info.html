<p>
    Holi is the celebration of spring and love for many people around the world. Holi lasts for one night and one day, and begins on the first full moon of March, which is usually during the middle of the month.The first night is known as Holika Dahan, and the next day is known as Holi. Holi was created in Ancient India as a religious Hindu Festival. In more recent years, many people around the world celebrate Rangwali Holi, which is when people throw colored powders at each other. On the night before Rangwali Holi, people perform a yagna, or a religious bonfire, to pray that their internal evil is desroyed. This is because the sister of the demon king, who was extreamly evil, was destroyed in a fire. After that, Rangwali Holi is celebratd, and people come together to have fun with their family and friends. The colors are thrown at everyone, and thrown everywhere. In the evening, people visit other people houses, and share food.
